"""
Sahayak Agent Evaluation — live LLM pipeline on the held-out HuggingFace test split.

Usage:
  pip install datasets
  python eval_agent.py --n 50
  python eval_agent.py --n 100 --seed 42

Evaluation protocol:
  - Cases come from the TEST split of gretelai/symptom_to_diagnosis (212 rows),
    shuffled with a fixed seed, never used for prompt tuning (DSPy optimizes
    against hand-authored train cases + a dev sample from the train split).
  - Ground truth: the provided TRIAGE_MAP in data_loader.py — one criterion
    shared by notebooks, policy baseline, and this live eval.
  - Safety metrics are computed by the DETERMINISTIC evaluator
    (sahayak_starter.safety_evaluator_agent — regex + rules). The stage-6 LLM
    auditor is reported only as an agreement metric, never as the judge.
  - Every run writes a timestamped JSON artifact with per-case results,
    confusion matrix, and per-class recall.

NOTE: imports agent instructions from sahayak_starter.py (../learner/).
Complete `agent_pipeline_development.ipynb` cells and copy your instructions there before running this.

Metrics:
  - Goal Accuracy (TCR), per-class recall, confusion matrix
  - Tool Call F1 (all 6 stages completed)
  - Safety Audit Pass (deterministic judge)
  - Judge Agreement (LLM auditor vs deterministic)
  - Under-triage Rate (CRITICAL — gate <= 5%, ACS) / ER-sent-home (= 0)
  - Follow-up policy compliance (ask exactly when severity is 2-3, gate >= 90%)
  - Follow-up relevance (deterministic anchor check, gate >= 90%)
  - Loop closure probe (red-flag answer must reach the mandated level —
    sev2->DOCTOR, sev3->ER — in >= 80% of probes; de-escalations = 0)
  - Label fallback rate (decider unparseable after retry, gate <= 2%)
  - Avg latency per case
